## Automated Report Generation using Python

This project is part of the CodeTech Python Programming Internship. The objective of Task 2 is to demonstrate how Python can be used to read data from a file, process it, and generate an automated PDF report.

In this task, a text file containing numerical values is used as input. The Python script reads the data from the file, converts it into integers, and performs basic calculations such as total and average. After processing the data, a formatted PDF report is generated using the FPDF library.

This project highlights the use of file handling, data processing, and report generation in Python. It shows how Python can automate reporting tasks by converting raw data into structured and readable documents.
